## Problem Description

I just tried to copy two files from a MacBook to an iPad via AirDrop:

- One of them was located in the _Downloads_ folder worked as usual
- the other one, which was located in a subfolder below _Downloads_, resulted in an immediate error:

> The operation couldn't be completed. (SFOperation Error -10)

I was getting crazy, and it took me a while until I found one [conversation on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/1bzlzn8/getting_sfoperation_error_10_when_trying_to/), which gave me the right solution: *just move the file to a different folder*.

Seriously, after moving the file up into the _Downloads_ folder, AirDrop was able to transfer it.


## Root Cause Analysis (RCA)

Usually I don't care so much about such banalties, but as the subfolder contained spaces and umlauts, I was trying to figure out what confused my dear Apple device.

- try again the same 2 days later: ‚ùå fails with same error message
- creating a copy of the folder `2024-xx-xx foob√§r copy` and copying the file from there: ‚úÖ works (so it seems _not_ to be related to the characters in the path)
- renaming the original folder and adding a single character to the end: ‚úÖ works (so what was the problem now?)
- renaming the renamed folder back by removing the additional character: ‚úÖ works (are you kidding me?)

So I'm now no longer able to reproduce the problem. The true root cause will - as so often - stay a mystery üòñ.
